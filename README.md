Week 1 Webpage cleanup

with this challenge we were asked to clean up the html and css files of any duplicates and unnessisary code 

while doing this project i didnt think there would be to much to learn but that quickly channed from removing multiple 
duplicates to changind div tags to a more suitable tag such as <header> or <nav>.

doing this will impove the accessablility of the webpage which will help improve the ammount of traffic visiting the page 

I startd by changing as many of the div tags as i could see was needed to add a better flow to the webpage before i started on the css trying to keep all the nessisary styling on the page. which didnt always go as planned such as with the benifits section not ligning up next to the three floating sections to the left cause of the inline-bloack tag assosiated with it i assume. and once i thought i had figured that one out it bunched together the three left side sections as shown in these screenshots below:
